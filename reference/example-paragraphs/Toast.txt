Prior to Wharton, I spent four years at Deloitte managing enterprise technology for government clients, where I focused on making mission-critical activities as frictionless as possible. As a former employee and frequent customer at Jeni's Ice Cream, which runs on Toast, I've experienced what that same principle looks like behind the counter. That dual perspective is why I'm drawn to {{Company}}.
