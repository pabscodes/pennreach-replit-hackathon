I need you to implement two features from our TASKS.md file: P0-6 and P0-10. Read
  TASKS.md for full specs, but here's the summary:

  P0-6: New Contact — Drag & drop + multi-file upload
  In NewContact.jsx Stage 1:
  - Add a drag & drop zone with visual feedback (highlight on drag over)
  - Support dropping and selecting multiple files at once
  - Show a list of uploaded files with file type icons (PDF, image) and a remove button
   for each
  - Combine content from all uploaded files before sending to the parse endpoint

  On the server (POST /api/contacts/parse):
  - Accept multiple files via multipart form-data
  - Update the multer config in server/middleware/upload.js for multiple files
  - Parse each file, concatenate/merge the extracted text, and send combined text to AI
   for a single structured parse
  - Single file upload should still work exactly as before

  P0-10: Settings — Gmail & Google Calendar OAuth integration
  Google OAuth setup:
  - Set up OAuth 2.0 flow with scopes: gmail.send, gmail.compose, calendar.readonly
  - Environment variables needed: GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,
  GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI

  Server auth routes:
  - GET /api/auth/google — Initiate OAuth flow (redirect to Google)
  - GET /api/auth/google/callback — Handle callback, store tokens
  - Token refresh logic (access tokens expire hourly)
  - Store googleAccessToken, googleRefreshToken, googleTokenExpiry in the DB (fields
  may already exist)

  Server Gmail routes (update server/routes/gmail.js):
  - POST /api/gmail/create-draft — Create draft in user's Gmail
  - POST /api/gmail/send — Send an existing draft
  - GET /api/gmail/status — Check if Gmail is connected

  Server Calendar routes (update server/routes/calendar.js):
  - GET /api/calendar/free-slots — Find available meeting slots using Calendar API
  freebusy.query, respecting user working hours
  - Integrate free slots into draft generation so AI can suggest specific meeting times

  Client Settings page:
  - Gmail section: "Connect Gmail" button → OAuth flow → shows connected email +
  "Disconnect" button
  - Calendar section: "Connect Google Calendar" button → same flow → shows connected +
  "Disconnect"

  Client NewContact page:
  - After draft is finalized, show "Create Gmail Draft" or "Send via Gmail" options
  - Show suggested meeting times from calendar in the availability section

  Do NOT touch any other P0 issues. Only implement P0-6 and P0-10. Commit each feature
  separately.
